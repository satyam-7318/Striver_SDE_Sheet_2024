// Given an array arr[] of n positive integers which can contain integers from 1 to p where elements can be repeated or can be absent from the array.
// Your task is to count the frequency of all numbers from 1 to n. Do modify the array in-place changes in arr[], such that arr[i] = frequency(i) and assume 1-based indexing.

// Note: The elements greater than n in the array can be ignored for counting. 

// Examples

// Input: n = 5 arr[] = {2, 3, 2, 3, 5} p = 5
// Output: 0 2 2 0 1
// Explanation: Counting frequencies of each array element We have: 1 occurring 0 times. 2 occurring 2 times. 3 occurring 2 times. 4 occurring 0 times. 5 occurring 1 time.
// Input: n = 4  arr[] = {3,3,3,3} p = 3
// Output: 0 0 4 0
// Explanation: Counting frequencies of each array element We have: 1 occurring 0 times. 2 occurring 0 times. 3 occurring 4 times. 4 occurring 0 times.
// Input: n = 2 arr[] = {8,9} p = 9
// Output: 0 0
// Explanation: Counting frequencies of each array element We have: 1 occurring 0 times. 2 occurring 0 times. Since here P=9, but there are no 9th Index present so can't count the value.
// Your Task:
// You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function frequencyCount() that takes the array arr, and integers n, and p as input parameters and modify the array in-place to denote the frequency count of each element from 1 to N.

// Expected time complexity: O(N)
// Expected auxiliay space: O(1)

// Constraints:
// 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
// 1 ≤ p ≤ 4*10^4 
// 1 <= arr[i] <= p
